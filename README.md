## MySQL Database Project

This project is a simple CRUD application that aims to simulate creating, getting and updating test results in company's database. I deployed MySQL server locally and restored database from dump file, it was already populated with mock test projects, authors and tests. I cannot provide this database dump here as it was part of my internship.

Goal of this tests was to work with this database using C#.

### Patterns and technologies used:
* NUnit as test framework
* MySQL package for C#
* Model Classes for data

### Test Case 1

| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Run any tests  | The tests were executed  |
| Postconditions |
| Add a result of each completed test in the database as a new record in the corresponding table |  Information is added  |
