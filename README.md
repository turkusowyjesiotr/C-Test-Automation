# C-Test-Automation

Hello! Welcome to my portfolio of C# test automation. In this repo there are 5 branches and each of them contains one simple automation project. Every branch has its own readme.md file describing test case(s), technologies used and goals of the project. All of them were checked by my mentor from **a1qa** company, where I was on internship. These projects are not all of my work on this internship, but some things that I wanted to show. There were also plenty of theory and other things, but those information you should have in my CV!
